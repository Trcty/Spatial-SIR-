# Spatial-SIR-Model
Solve spatial SIR model and visualize 


In order to visualize how the infection spreads spatially over time, instead of only visualizing the total number of infections as a function of time, Create a M by N grid in which each (x, y) grid tile corresponds to a local S.I.R.model. RGB is used in animation to represent condition in a local S.I.R. model. Both RK4 and ode45 are used to solve system of differential equations for calculation time comparison.
